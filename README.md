# Roguelike Dungeon Generator

This Generator features an algorithm I designed myself after seeing many procedural environments in games such as Rogue and Tinykeep. I created this as a submission for a scripting module at University.

The map generated is used by the parser which then instantiates the various tiles needed to create the dungeon. Specifically a mixture of Big and small sized tiles are used with individual wall and floor pieces allowing for easier itteration of tiles and differing from the tileset i used in my [Maze Game](https://github.com/Tezza48/DigitalScripting_Seeds).
